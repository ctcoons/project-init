## What To Do Next

---

- I need to figure out what to make the project landing page needs to look like
- Move everything to my branch of MSConnect
- Talk with the other lab members about how they want to access their project
- On the Upload, If Success==No, "Confirm" shouldn't be clickable
- I Don't think The Project Should be started yet until they click "Confirm"
